# odin-library

Time for completion: 17 days - approximately 10 hours active time

Topics learned:
- Constructors & Prototypes
- DOM Manipulation
- Functions

This project was something I was vey interested in getting right. Popup forms with information that can be insert into the DOM seems to be a very common application among websites and a gateway into the extremely common CRUD applications that most SaaS sites rely on. I feel that the Prototype function that performs the DOM manipulation in my code is overly clunky and verbose. I intend to use what I learned while writing this program to further increase the efficiency and readability of my code in future projects.

Overall, I am very happy with my results from the JS side. CSS needs some work, but I intend to learn more about that with practice as the cirriculum continues.
