------------------------ PREVIOUS PROJECT ASSIGNMENT (Classes) ---------------------------

Time for completion: approximately 3 hours active time

Topics learned:
- Classes
- "this" keyword

Perfect project! Already having all of the working code from the previous constructor project by my side was fantastic for allowing me to focus solely on the Class integration into the code without having to re-do the HTML and CSS. As I stated before, my HTML and CSS need some serious work, but I've been thoroughly enjoying the JS side of things lately. I'm sure I'll go back and learn more about the layout and design some more in the near future though. I understand this was only a "lesson" and not a full on Project, but it was still a great learning opportunity that I feel really made things "click" in my head.


------------------------ PREVIOUS PROJECT ASSIGNMENT (Constructors) ---------------------------

Time for completion: 17 days - approximately 10 hours active time

Topics learned:
- Constructors & Prototypes
- DOM Manipulation
- Functions

This project was something I was vey interested in getting right. Popup forms with information that can be insert into the DOM seems to be a very common application among websites and a gateway into the extremely common CRUD applications that most SaaS sites rely on. I feel that the Prototype function that performs the DOM manipulation in my code is overly clunky and verbose. I intend to use what I learned while writing this program to further increase the efficiency and readability of my code in future projects.

Overall, I am very happy with my results from the JS side. CSS needs some work, but I intend to learn more about that with practice as the cirriculum continues.
